<em>Double Concerto for two horns and chamber orchestra</em> was written between November 2013 and March 2014, premiered by Jeff Nelsen, Michael Walker, and the Eastman Musica Nova Ensemble with conductor Brad Lubman on March 21, 2014... We discussed the use of a "fluid" early valve horn technique that would utilize the natural partials available on each of the instruments, following in the footsteps of Ligeti's Horn Trio and Hamburg Concerto, one of his last works. Ligeti writes about his own work on the Hamburg Concerto: "In this piece I experimented with very unusual non-harmonic sound spectra... there are four natural horns, each of which can produce the 2nd to the 16th overtone. By providing each ... with different fundamentals I was able to construct novel sound spectra from the resulting overtones."...
