      Jason Thorpe Buchanan is an American composer of opera, orchestral, chamber, electroacoustic, and intermedia works that explore fragmentation, multiplicity, intelligibility, and the integration of live performance with technology. He is currently Artistic Director of <a href="http://www.switchensemble.com" target="blank">the [Switch~ Ensemble]</a>, and Department Chair/Lecturer in Composition, Theory, and Electronic Music Composition at the <a href="https://www.music.mahidol.ac.th/en/" target="blank">College of Music, Mahidol University</a> in Thailand. His works have been described as "an uneathly collage of sounds", "sharply-edged", and "free jazz gone wrong--in a good way."

      Jason is the recipient of a 2010-11 Fulbright Fellowship at the Hochschule für Musik und Theater in Hamburg (DE) as a visiting scholar,
      a fellowship and commissions from Royaumont for <em>soliloquios del viento</em> (2016) for the <a href="http://taleaensemble.org/" target="blank">Talea Ensemble</a>+EXAUDI Vocal Ensemble
      and <em>ACTOR-NETWORK THEORY</em> (2017)
      for the Académie Voix Nouvelles Ensemble,
      a 2015 American-Scandinavian Foundation Grant,
      a 2014 commission from the International Horn Society and 2015 ASCAP Morton Gould Award for <em>Double Concerto</em> (2014) written for the Eastman Musica Nova Ensemble, soloists Jeff Nelsen, Michael Walker, and conductor Brad Lubman,
      a 2014 ASCAP Morton Gould Award & Howard Hanson Orchestral Prize (2014) for <em>Asymptotic Flux: Second Study in Entropy</em> (2013) commissioned by the Mizzou International Composers Festival for <a href="www.alarmwillsound.com" target="blank">Alarm Will Sound</a>,
      a commission from the Blue Water Chamber Orchestra as winner of Iron Composer (2014), commissions from <a href="http://www.ensemblenikel.com/" target="blank">Ensemble Nikel</a> (Israel, 2014) and <a href="http://www.iktuspercussion.com" target="blank">Iktus Percussion</a> (2013),
      the German/American Fulbright Commission (2011) and winner of newEar Composer’s Competition (2013).
<br><br>
      In 2015, as Artist-in-Residence at USF Verftet/City Council of Bergen, Norway and nominee for the Gaudeamus Prize,
      three works were presented by Insomnio, New European Ensemble, and Slagwerk Den Haag at Gaudeamus Muziekweek (NL).
<br><br>
      His works </em>walkside, lost</em> and <em>gimme shelter</em> (2015), commissioned by Gaudeamus Muziekweek and Eklekto Percussion Geneva,
      both explore the structural intersection of precise physical gestures, fragile sounds, and speech alongside live audio and video processing. Three speaking percussionists manipulate household objects, microphones, and speakers embedded in wooden boxes while cameras generate a reservoir of video files.
      These files are retrieved, re-organized, and composited against one another, creating temporal, aural, and visual dissonances between past and present actions.

<br><br>
      As 2018 Artist-In-Residence at the Embassy of Foreign Artists in Geneva, Switzerland, he developed a new, interactive processing environment for <em>surface, tension</em> (2018),
      responding directly to the discrete physical gestures of performers and governing the behavior of both signal processing and soundfile triggering through wearable technology, sensors, and motion tracking.

<br><br>
      <em>PANIC ARCHITECTURE</em> (2017), commissioned by the Earle Brown Music Foundation for the Talea Ensemble and TIME SPANS Festival in NYC, evokes a participatory framework demanding compulsive interaction and attention. The relentless influx of email, messages, and notifications compel our constant engagement and response, functioning as both our tether to society and primary mode of interpersonal contact. Intermittent reinforcement entices users to obsessively check for new content. Digital panic occurs when multiple, simultaneous systems demand a user’s attention concurrently.
