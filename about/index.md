<!-- new sentence --> His works <em>walkside, lost</em> and <em>gimme shelter</em> (2015), commissioned by Gaudeamus Muziekweek and by
<a href="https://eklekto.ch/en/" target="blank">Eklekto Percussion Geneva</a>, both explore the structural intersection of precise physical gestures, fragile sounds, and speech alongside live audio and video processing.

<!-- new sentence --> Three speaking percussionists manipulate household objects, microphones, and speakers embedded in wooden boxes while cameras generate a reservoir of video files. These files are retrieved, re-organized, and composited against one another, creating temporal, aural, and visual dissonances between past and present actions.

<!-- new sentence --> As 2018 Artist-In-Residence at the
<<a href="https://www.eofa.ch/en/" target="blank">Embassy of Foreign Artists</a> in Geneva, Switzerland, he developed a new, interactive processing environment for <em>surface, tension</em> (2018), responding directly to the discrete physical gestures of performers and governing the behavior of both signal processing and soundfile triggering through wearable technology, sensors, and motion tracking.

<em>PANIC ARCHITECTURE</em> (2017), commissioned by the Earle Brown Music Foundation for the Talea Ensemble and
<a href="https://timespans.org/" target="blank">TIME SPANS Festival</a> in NYC, evokes a participatory framework demanding compulsive interaction and attention. The relentless influx of email, messages, and notifications compel our constant engagement and response, functioning as both our tether to society and primary mode of interpersonal contact. Intermittent reinforcement entices users to obsessively check for new content. Digital panic occurs when multiple, simultaneous systems demand a user’s attention concurrently.

“<em>Hunger</em> is a kind of training session in mental disintegration... An ungodly opera needs ugly music, singers who produce primal sounds, an electric guitar that sounds scraped raw, a wailing orchestra effects, cuts the ear like a knife. Buchanan delivers.” <em>&#8212; L.A. Times</em>



<br><br>
<!-- new para -->
<em>all-forgetting-is-retrieval</em> (2019) for ensemble and augmented conductor was commissioned by the Thailand New Music and Arts Symposium, exploring the formation of human memory, retrieval, failure, and the emotional space of "lost" experiences&#8212;the inability to be truly present in a moment, or further commit to memory experiences that are simultaneously both formative and fleeting. The rapid loss of their fidelity is staggering, and this work attempt to confront that impermanence and decay.
<!-- new para -->
<em>Reflexive Iterations</em> (2020) for quintet and extended no-input mixer is, in some way, in response to the events of 2020 and designed as an antidote to life on the internet. A system dealing with corporeal attributes of physical space&#8212;air, sound, bodies&#8212;in a way that would not be possible with a digital system. The precise result is unknown prior to performance&#8212;subject to a staggering number of variables&#8212;as musicians interpret suggested physical actions while responding to their ramifications in an attempt to control a thing that, by its very nature, is precarious and mercurial.
