I"£<p>dou‚Ä¢ble‚Ä¢think : a simultaneous acceptance of or belief in two contradictory ideas; thought marked by the acceptance of gross contradictions and falsehoods, especially when used as a technique of political or self-indoctrination. ‚ÄúTo know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truthfulness while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which canceled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic, to repudiate morality while laying claim to it‚Ä¶Even to understand the word ‚Äòdoublethink‚Äô involved the use of doublethink.‚Äù - George Orwell, Nineteen-Eighty-Four (1949)</p>
