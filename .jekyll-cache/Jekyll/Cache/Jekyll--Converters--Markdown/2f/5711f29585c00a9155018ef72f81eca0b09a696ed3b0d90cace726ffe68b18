I"ÿ<p><em>walkside, lost</em> and <em>gimme shelter</em>  are two works in a cycle of compositions for three percussionists, electronics, and live video processing on texts by poet Darcie Dennigan, the first for Gaudeamus Muziekweek &amp; Slagwerk Den Haag, the second for Eklekto Percussion Geneva. The pieces both revolve around the structural intersections of precisely notated gestures that influence human performance with software systems that influence behavior of multimedia, the obfuscation or recontextualization of semantic content in speech, and the way in which confusion and ambiguity distort a participant's perception. The systems I have designed for these works serve to generate reservoirs of video and audio in real-time that are recalled, manipulated, and re-composited against themselves during the live performanceâ€¦ <a href="http://www.jasonthorpebuchanan.com/portfolio---soliloquios-del-viento.html" data-fancybox="" data-type="iframe"><font color="#1a7ecd">(complete program notes...)</font></a></p>
