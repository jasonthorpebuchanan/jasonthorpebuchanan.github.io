I"ç<p><em>oggetti II (2021)</em>, written between November 17 and December 7, 2021 for the TACETi Ensemble and Thailand New Music and Arts Symposium, is the second work in a larger cycle exploring concise musical objects, gestures, and formal constellations. Over time, my compositional process has become increasingly introspective and criticalâ€”thus, <em>oggetti II</em> is an attempt to re-capture the spirit of my earlier works with a more spontaneous and economical nature. <em>oggetti I (Omaggio a Sciarrino)</em> for wind quintet and <em>antistasis</em> for Ensemble Nikel were composed nearly simultaneously in a 10-day period during the summer of 2014 in NYC. Many concepts and compositional devices are shared, but not musical materials. antistasis, meaning opposition, is a rhetorical term for the repetition of a word or phrase in a different or contrary sense. This was poetically translated through the repetition of a small number of musical gestures, or objects, continually recurring and recontextualized so as to contribute to the composite in different ways. oggetti I and now oggetti II both function in a similar manner, drawing upon extremely limited materials reconfigured in various ways, something like a musical jigsaw puzzle.</p>
