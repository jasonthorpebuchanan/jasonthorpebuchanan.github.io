I"<p><em>Asymptotic Flux: First Study in Entropy</em> was written over a three month period while traveling and hitchhiking throughout Europe, surrounding time spent attending at the IRCAM and Darmstadt. […] In addition to sonorities that are worked out through sampling and spectral analysis of multiphonics, additional pitch content is generated through an acoustic analogue to a process known in electronic music as “single-sideband modulation”, resulting in a series of combination tones made by adding two frequencies to one another. […] The title comes from an arguably conceptual device: the low E-flat that simultaneously pervades the work and is non-existent. I imagine the ensemble is always reaching towards this E-flat as a point of centricity, but never quite arrive; analogous to an asymptote, as it approaches infinity. Entropy can be described as the “measure of the disorder or randomness in a closed system,” or the tendency for all matter and energy in the universe to evolve toward a state of inert uniformity.”…</p>
