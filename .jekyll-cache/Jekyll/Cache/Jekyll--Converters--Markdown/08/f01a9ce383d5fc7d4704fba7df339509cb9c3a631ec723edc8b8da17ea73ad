The work is structured around two pages of text, culled from over 18,000 words generated by the DadaDodo engine, a class of program known as ‚Äúdissociators‚Äù that ‚Äúanalyses texts for word probabilities, generating random sentences based on that.‚Äù ‚Ä¶ ANT was developed by Latour and others as an analytical tool to map and attempt to explain relationships and interactions between human and non-human ‚Äòactors‚Äô, exploring how material-semiotic networks are formed, hold together, or fall apart‚Ä¶</p>
