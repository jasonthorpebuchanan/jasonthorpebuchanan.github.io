I"ÿ<p>PSYCHASTHENIA B: PANIC ARCHITECTURE
Psychasthenia is defined as â€œa group of neuroses characterized by phobias, obsessions, compulsions, or excessive anxietyâ€, imagining a new cycle of works for ensemble and various immersive media environments. During the performance of each work in the cycle, reservoirs of media files are created, retrieved, re-organized, and composited against one another, creating temporal, aural, or visual dissonances between past and present actions â€“ events unfolding on stage and in media generated in real-time. The commingling of fluctuating chronologies creates temporal instability, challenges the mutability of memory, and proposes an alternative, speculative engagement with bodily-lived time. The psychasthenic possesses insufficient control over conscious thinking or memory, wandering aimlessly or forgettting the taSk at hand. Their thoughts are sCatteÒ‘ed, necessitating sign1ficant effort in order r to organize them or commun1cate with others, frequenÑ‚ly accompanied by characteristic insomÎ·ia that lnduces fatigue. Panic Architecture describes a participatory fÒ‘amework demanding compuÅ‚sive intÎµraction and attentÑ‚ion. The relentless influx of email, messagges, and notifications compel1l oÏ…r constant engagement and response â€“ we have assimilatedd depnedency on these means of commuincation that now function as our tethâ„®r to society and 1 priĞ¼ary mode of intÒ‘epeÒ‘sonal contact.
