Apr. 6, 2018: I'm thrilled to share that I have accepted accepted a position as full-time Lecturer in Composition, Theory, and Electronic Music at Mahidol University's College of Music in Thailand, starting in June. Furthermore, I'll be forming and directing a new music ensemble with performance faculty and advanced students to perform during the 2018 Thailand International Composition Festival (TICF) and other events.
