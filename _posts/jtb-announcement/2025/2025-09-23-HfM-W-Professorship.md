In October, as I approach 3 years living in Germany and teaching at the Hybrid Music Lab in Dresden, I will begin a new role as Professor für Komposition mit digitalen Medien at the Hochschule für Musik Würzburg in Bavaria. I will be leading our new Masters program in Komposition mit Neuen Medien, as well as the HfM Würzburg's Studio for experimentelle elektronische Musik ("eem"), founded in the 1970s and newly rebuilt with support from the "Hightech Agenda Bayern".

It is bittersweet to be leaving my excellent colleagues and students here in Dresden, but I will continue teaching at the HfM Dresden through the end of this calendar year as we complete our "Musik und Digitalität" project here at the Hybrid Music Lab in Dresden. 

The HfM Würzburg will be accepting applications to the first cohort of our new Masters program in Komposition mit Neuen Medien until March 15 (to begin studies in October 2026). Seminars and lessons will be held in our brand new studios, with many excellent projects and developments already being planned alongside the incoming director of our Ensemble Neue Musik (who will be announced soon)! If you know anyone who may be interested in our new Masters program, please put them in touch with me directly. Interviews with myself and my new colleagues Prof. Andreas Dohmen and Hannes Brugger will take place in Würzburg, May 2026.
