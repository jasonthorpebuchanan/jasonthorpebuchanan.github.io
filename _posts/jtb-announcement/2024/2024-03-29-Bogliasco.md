"I'm thrilled to have been awarded a 2024 Aaron Copland Bogliasco Fellowship in Music, where I will spend November-December as an Artist-in-Residence at their Study Center on the coast of Genoa, Italy. This Special Fellowship is generously funded by the Aaron Copland Fund for Music."

via Bogliasco:
"We are pleased to announce Bogliasco's Fall 2024 Fellowship awardees â€“ a group of 26 artists and scholars representing 12 disciplines, 9 countries, and 4 continents. These exceptional early, mid, and late-career individuals, who range in age from 31 to 78, will be divided into 3 distinct cohorts, developing work during month-long residencies between September and December.
Enormous thanks to this year's 34 panelists and oversight committee members from all the disciplines who were charged with selection: a careful peer review process that becomes more challenging each year as the number of applicants steadily increases." https://www.bfny.org/en/fellows/upcoming-fellows?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAAR1qldh8GVKVgqmEfWEYtGaxmrtDu7Nn7qQUfkgq1wZn3NJE4qssWRs5GK4_aem_AbYQO8dV7EYjjbDy5ymteDRmywTAUFLnkAFI7-0bgvtZ4doS1lADFiErsRrH3pWbQd1Garti3YStedDL_iQt0D2l
