I'm thrilled to be joining the faculty as Visiting Lecturer in Composition & Interim Director of the Electronic Music Studios (UTEMS) at the Butler School of Music - University of Texas at Austin, Fall 2020. I will be teaching Introduction to Computer Music: Visual Programming with Max (MUS 329J), private lessons, an Electronic Music Seminar for Graduate Students, and managing studio activities as well as digital events during the Covid-19 Pandemic.
