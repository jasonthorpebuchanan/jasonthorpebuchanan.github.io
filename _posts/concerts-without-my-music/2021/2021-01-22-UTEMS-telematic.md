The [Switch~ Ensemble] is ensemble-in-residence for a Telematic Residency at the Butler School of Music, UT Austin. We'll be premiering five brand new works by graduate student composers, written specifically for [Switch~] to be performed telematically using our proprietary "TeleRouter" software developed by Jason Thorpe Buchanan.
