== ABOUT MATHESON ==

Create a truly unique design with Matheson, a lightweight and fully responsive HTML5 theme. Use the theme customizer to add your own background, page layout, site width and more. Distinguish each post with one of the eight supported post formats, such as: Video, Image, Aside, Status, Audio, Quote, Link and Gallery. Install JetPack to display each of your galleries through a tiled view and jQuery carousel. Compatible with bbPress & BuddyPress. Built using SASS, Compass and Bootstrap 3. Matheson uses Google Fonts for improved typeface readability and works perfectly in desktop browsers, tablets and handheld devices. For a live demo go to http://demos.bavotasan.com/matheson/.

== NOTES ==

* If you have a drop down list for your site navigation, the parent item should only be a grouping title with a "#" value for the URL parameter. The Bootstrap navbar requires a click to open the drop down list so any link that is set in the parent item will not work.
* The navbar only allows for a depth of one drop down level.
* The three boxes on the home page are Image & Text widgets added to the Home Page Top Area.
* The home page is designed without any sidebars therefore the only widgetized areas that appear are the Home Page Top Area and the Extended Footer. Archive and search results pages also have no sidebars.
* Sidebars only appear on single posts and pages, unless they are set to display at full width.
